# Cancer DiagnosisNet

Cancer DiagnosisNet is a machine learning project that utilizes a deep neural network to predict cancer diagnosis based on certain features. It aims to provide accurate and efficient cancer diagnosis assistance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [cancer.csv](cancer.csv). It contains information about various features related to cancer cases, including the diagnosis (1 for malignant, 0 for benign). The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module.

## Requirements

To run the Cancer DiagnosisNet project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- TensorFlow

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy tensorflow

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-diagnosisnet.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd cancer-diagnosisnet\

3. Place the `cancer.csv` dataset file in the project directory.

4. Run the script

5. The model will be trained on the dataset, and the training progress will be displayed in the console. Once training is complete, the model's performance metrics will be shown.
